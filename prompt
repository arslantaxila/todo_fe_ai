1. Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a To-Do List application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks efficiently. The system will include essential user authentication features like sign up, login, and logout, ensuring secure access to user-specific tasks. Each user will have their personalized to-do list, with options to add, edit, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.

Backend is already developed and deployed.

Develop the frontend using following backend endpoints, and remember to develop separate pages for ease of usability and customization:

Backend Endpoints:
Auth/Users:
http://localhost:3000/api/users/signup
router.post('/signup', validateSignup, UserController.signup);
http://localhost:3000/api/users/login
router.post('/login', validateLogin, UserController.login);
http://localhost:3000/api/users/profile
router.put('/profile', authMiddleware, UserController.updateProfile);

Tasks:
http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/add
router.post('/add', authMiddleware, TaskController.addTask);
http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/view
router.get('/view', authMiddleware, TaskController.viewTasks);
http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/edit
router.put('/edit', authMiddleware, TaskController.editTask);
http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/completed
router.patch('/completed', authMiddleware, TaskController.completeTask);
http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/delete
router.delete('/delete', authMiddleware, TaskController.deleteTask);


Database Structure:
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    due_date DATE,
    priority ENUM('High', 'Medium', 'Low'),
    status ENUM('Pending', 'Completed') DEFAULT 'Pending',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
